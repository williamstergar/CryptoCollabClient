// I want a message at the center of the screen saying "Welcome to CryptoCollab. Join thousands of users across the world in sharing anything and everything crypto".

// I want the Login/Signup button in the top right corner that, when clicked, takes you to the login and registration page.

// From there, it will take you to a page where you can create a crypto and a collab, and then view yours and others at the same time. You will also be able to delete your crypto or collab here, too.
